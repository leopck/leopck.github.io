title: Development of Education Platform (Part 1)
---

Just musing around an idea of developing an Education Platform based on Jekyll and Github. I've seen multiple similar implementation using Gits for Books and Gits for learning and educations. GitBooks and the Git Awesome Lists are fine examples of them.

With those in mind, I'm planning to create an open source platform for Education that is able to cater to different mechanisms of learnings instead of limiting to one type.

1. Interactive learning like (trygit)
2. Textbook learning like (packt books)
3. Learning by examples like (tutorialpoints)
4. Learning by projects
5. Learning by videos like Youtube

All of these should be implemented git-like. Allowing anyone with materials to implement their materials in several methods rather than restricting them to learning via one method only.

This is design with curating materials and being open source at the same time.


```
#include <stdio.h>

void main(){
  printf("Test %s", "junk");
}
```
