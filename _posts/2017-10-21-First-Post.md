I've finally decided to migrate away from Blogspot due to the lack of templates, designs and inflexibility of changing some things. Furthermore, making changes to the templates are anything but simple.

I have been eye-ing out on using Jekyll + Github for a long time now, but I never saw it thru until I came across [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

To those of you that aren't familiar with Jekyll, it's basically a converter to convert the ordinary markdown languages into static HTML. Meaning the ordinary .md files or plain text files in Github can be converted into HTML! How sweet is that. This helps a lot since most of us would want a simple, flexible and yet fast website.

Of course, the downside would be that all your source codes for the website is also open sourced unless you pay $7/per month to create a private repo in Github. That's not an issue for me as most of my contents are made to public for sharing either way.

There are a few more things that I need to iron out the details like the Google Analytics, Disqus, adding designs, logos, and so on. (Hopefully I can get three more features into this blog: Google AMPS, AngularJS, Database via JSON + YAML)

I'll be migrating all my old posts from Blogspot into here shortly stay tuned.
