Most people believes that learning programming is simply learning how to code and not understanding anything more However, most of them fail to become capable or great programmers due to the lack of understanding of concepts of hardware and the theories hence, causing most of them to be a copy and paste programmers rather than knowing how to decipher logics. There shouldn't exist a difference between software and hardware as a great Software Engineer would understand both hardware and software.

This course is in the means of creating a better software engineer by means of thoroughly understanding about the science of software and hardware.
