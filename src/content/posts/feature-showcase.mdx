Welcome to the new **Fridays with Faraday**. We have upgraded the platform to support the rigorous needs of systems performance engineering. 

### 1. Interactive Performance Analysis
Understanding if a kernel is memory-bound or compute-bound is easier with interactive tools. Use the slider below to see how arithmetic intensity shifts the "performance dot" along the roofline curve.

<RooflinePlot 
  peakFlops={312} 
  peakBw={2039} 
  initialTime={1.2} 
  title="FlashAttention-2 Kernel Analysis" 
/>

### 2. Rigorous Mathematical Notation
For complex performance proofs, we now use specialized Theorem and Proof containers to distinguish theory from implementation.

<Theorem type="Theorem" title="The Roofline Intersection">
  For a processor with peak performance $\pi$ (TFLOPS) and peak bandwidth $\beta$ (GB/s), the ridge point $I_{ridge}$ where an algorithm transitions from memory-bound to compute-bound is defined as:
  $$I_{ridge} = \frac{\pi}{\beta}$$
</Theorem>

### 3. Reproducibility & Colab Integration
Notice the **"Run in Google Colab"** button at the top of this post. It dynamically links to the Jupyter Notebook associated with this technical analysis, allowing you to run the benchmarks yourself.

### 4. Reading Progress
As you scroll down this post, watch the **accent-blue bar** at the very top of your browser. It provides visual feedback for long-form technical deep-dives (especially useful for our 25+ minute "expert" series).

### 5. Multi-Author Support
At the bottom of this page, you will see a dynamic Author Bio. By moving authors to a separate data collection, we now support guest contributions from the wider performance engineering community.
