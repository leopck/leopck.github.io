- [x] 4.3 Verify all required analysis types are included
- [x] 4.4 Final formatting and organization

## Expected Deliverables
1. `posts/esp32/esp32-ultra-low-power.md` - Sub-1µA sleep analysis
2. `posts/esp32/esp32-adc-performance.md` - High-speed ADC analysis
3. `posts/esp32/esp32-wifi-performance.md` - Real-time WiFi analysis
4. `posts/esp32/esp32-power-management.md` - Power management trade-offs

Each post will include:
- Register-level programming and analysis
- Memory dump analysis
- Interrupt vector table analysis
- Assembly code analysis
- Real-time performance measurement
- Power consumption analysis
- Oscilloscope analysis of timing
- Hardware modification analysis
