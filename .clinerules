# Context & Memory Management
You must maintain a "Memory Bank" to prevent context bloat.

## The Memory Bank Files
1. `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Tracks the current technical state, active files, and complex logic decisions.
2. `memory-bank/progress.md`: A simple list of "Done" vs "Remaining" tasks.

## Rules for Compaction
- **Update Frequency:** After every 3-5 major tool calls or a significant code change, update the Memory Bank files.
- **Content Density:** Keep summaries technical and "dense." Focus on "Why" something was done, not just "What."
- **Failure Logs:** If a solution fails, record the reason in `activeContext.md` so we don't try it again.
- **Context Awareness:** If you see "Input Tokens" approaching 150k, stop immediately. Summarize the current state into the Memory Bank and tell the user: "Context reached. Please start a new session."
